<p>
  Welcome to the site for general information and audio submission for AS220's
  Jukebox located across from the main doors in the AS220 Bar / Restaurant
  (115 Empire Street). AS220's Jukebox is the only all original,
  uncensored/unjuried music jukebox in known existence. Pay artists directly
  simply by inserting a quarter OR submit music and have royalty checks flowing
  into your pocket with each song play. All construction plans and software is
  made freely available for others to build out their own jukeboxes, free as in
  freedom.

  AS220 Jukebox provides for the democratization of audio played and listened
  to around the periphery of the AS220 Bar and Restaurant. Listen to a wealth
  of Rhode Island music/audio and know that each play supports local music
  through a percentage of the profits being deposited directly into the pockets
  of musicians that live within the Rhode Island community. Enjoy the added
  possibility that the audio/music featured within the machine might only exist
  in a form not suitable for live performance. Know that the
  uncensored/unjuried freedom provides for the possibility of a wide-range in
  audio selection with a total of approximately 187,500 audio tracks all
  awaiting play for the super-saver price of a quarter.

  Reclaim culture by making culture and in turn having it showcased in the
  AS220 Jukebox. Each song costs a quarter per a play with 70% of the proceeds
  going directly into your pocket; 30% being donated to AS220. Payment of money
  will occur at Christmas time for those submitters who have earned an amount
  greater than $20.00.
</p>
<p>
  Submission for audio/music is unjuried/uncensored which means that we, AS220,
  will not prohibit you from submitting audio provided that said audio is
  original music that you are authorized to license (created music, have been
  given the right to license the music). Songs will be verified prior to
  inclusion within the Jukebox. Submitted audio also requires that a physical
  contract be printed, signed, and hand delivered to AS220's main office during
  normal office hours. An example of the contract is
  available <a href="/contract.html">here</a> with the real contract being
  automatically generated based upon the music you submit. More details and the
  actual process can be obtained by registering an account and logging in.
</p>
<p>
  A submitted song must be less than one hour in length. All songs longer than
  6 minutes will be segmented up into 6 minute chunks that can be played in
  full by a user inserting multiple coins and selecting to play each segment in
  turn. The jukebox currently has room for approximately 187,500 songs. The
  total amount of room may be expanded at any time without notice. Upon the
  current limit being reached, the jukebox will automatically begin removing
  least played songs ordered by date of submission, oldest first.
</p>
<p>
  Currently there exists no limit to the rate of user submission. This is
  subject to change if abuses occur.
</p>
<p>
  Music submitted may very well exist in the jukebox permanently. This is to
  provide for a historic perspective of audio/music in Rhode Island. However,
  the licensing of AS220 to your music is non-exclusive which means that you
  can remove audio from the jukebox at any time. To accomplish this please
  login and mark songs for removal.

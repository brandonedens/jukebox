  <h1>Welcome to the AS220 Jukebox</h1>
  <p>
    Since 1985, AS220 has committed itself to supporting local artists and
    acting as an uncensored, unjuried forum for the arts. Part of this
    commitment includes a boycott of ASCAP/BMI and the blanket licensing system
    they use, which we believe hurts independent artists and bolsters the
    disproportionally paparazzi-frenzied, glitter-encrusted lives of
    homogony-inducing pop stars. We've always thought this boycott is a pretty
    sweet idea, and sets a radical precedent of how businesses and venues can
    function. That is, until it came to kicking out killer jams in the
    bar. After many years of trying to figure out how to create a seriously
    righteous fun-time party-saloon situation while still circumventing "The
    Man," AS220 is ready to unveil our greatest feat of ingenuity, fabrication,
    and merriment yet to date: behold, the AS220 Jukebox! This Jukebox and all
    the software it entails have been fashioned and fabricated on site by our
    crack team of rockers, beat-boxers, metal heads, computer geniuses, and
    super-nerds. Said magic machine will live in the bar, and will be filled to
    the brim with a veritable cornucopia of local, independent, and
    artist-approved ditties for your listening pleasure. This party-box will
    provide the non-stop soundtrack to your awesome times, and will be taking
    requests for a mere quarter. Crisis averted; problem solved! Local hits get
    played, and local artists get paid. Our bar outpours with stone-cold riffs,
    sick beats, and debaucherously chill vibes, resulting in your totally
    off-the-hizzle AS220 experience. No need to thank us. Our bar staff is as
    psyched as you are.

  <h1>For Artists: Business Arrangement Explanation for Uploading Music</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the AS220 Jukebox Music Page for uploading music. Here's the deal:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    One member of a band registers. The musician must affirm that s/he is a
    license holder of the music. The musician must affirm that s/he has been
    designated Jukebox business person of/by their band, and that their band is
    based in Rhode Island.  The band member must provide an email and physical
    Rhode Island address as well as a name to whom checks should be made out
    to.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the band member registers s/he may upload original music. Once a song
    is uploaded via this very site, it will be reviewed by a real live human
    (this might take up to a week). When verified as original music (no
    sneaking in Hit Me Baby One More Time) it goes onto the Jukebox at Empire
    St.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each time a Jukebox listener pays a quarter to select your song, our
    computer records it. AS220 pays the musician 70% of the take (18 cents per
    play), the same percentage split visual artists share in our galleries. If
    patrons are not selecting and paying for songs, the Jukebox will generate a
    random playlist. Bar and staff will also be given free plays. These free
    plays will not generate revenue for either AS220 or musicians.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once a year in mid-November a tally of purchased plays will be generated by
    Ye Olde Jukebox Computer, and checks will be cut to the credited
    musicians. HOWEVER, artists will not receive a check until they have earned
    $15 (at least 78 plays). Checks will be sent to the address that is in our
    system, so be sure to keep your information up to date. It is the
    musicians' responsibility to ensure that we have your current information.
  </li>
</ul>

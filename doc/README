Strategies for Automatically Starting Jukebox Software
======================================================

X11 Outside GDM on Ubuntu
-------------------------

Bypassing GDM startup under X11 first requires that you disable GDM upstart
script. To do this move the /etc/init/gdm.conf script out of the way::

  sudo mv /etc/init/gdm.conf /etc/init/gdm.conf.disabled

Then you need to change who is allowed to execute startx by modifing the
/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config file::

  sudo vim /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config

Change allowed_users=console to allowed_users=anybody.

To start X11 from the initialization system add an entry /etc/rc.local::

  su - jukebox startx

Now you must add entries to the jukebox user's ~/.xinitrc::

  #!/bin/bash
  jukebox-player &
  jukebox-random &
  exec awesome

As you'll notice here we've told the Awesome Window Manager to execute. Here we
use the Awesome window manager because its light-weight and starts quickly. To
ensure that jukebox and jukebox-buttons are started by Awesome we need to
install the default configuration for Awesome then modify it to execute these
two programs. To install the default configuration execute::

  mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome
  cp -rp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome/
  echo 'awful.util.spawn_with_shell("jukebox")' >> ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua
  echo 'awful.util.spawn_with_shell("jukebox-buttons")' >> ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua
